This RPG Card Game was developed over the course of one week in the summer of 2020.
The game runs off of the web - and was developed in C# using Unity and Visual Studio Code.

This was a submission for the game jam "I Want to Make a Game but I Can't Draw" as an introduction and a chance to show off my capabilities as a creative engineer.
Over the course of the week the game became closer and closer to production. The next steps in the game is to add a story - dialogue and content.
As a part of the game jam with limited time this was a minor part of the scope.
